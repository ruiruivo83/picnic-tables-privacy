<h1>Privacy Policy for Picnic Tables</h1>

<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> October 2025</p>

<p>Foxwood Apps (‚Äúwe,‚Äù ‚Äúour,‚Äù or ‚Äúus‚Äù) built the <strong>Picnic Tables</strong> mobile application as a free tool to help users discover and share picnic spots.  
This page is used to inform visitors regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information if anyone decides to use our app.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>

<p>The app uses your <strong>device location</strong> to display nearby picnic tables and allow you to add new spots.  
Location data is processed locally and sent only to our database when you add or update a spot.</p>

<p>When you submit a spot or review, we may collect:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Location coordinates (latitude & longitude)</li>
  <li>Photo(s) you voluntarily upload</li>
  <li>Optional title, description, and rating</li>
</ul>

<p>This information is stored securely in our Firebase database and is used solely to display and improve picnic locations for all users.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Log Data</h2>

<p>In case of an error, the app may collect log data (through third-party services such as Google Play Services) that may include your device name, operating system version, the configuration of the app when using it, and the time and date of use.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Cookies</h2>

<p>The Picnic Tables app itself does not use cookies. However, third-party libraries or services may use cookies to provide their services (e.g. Google Maps SDK).</p>

<hr>

<h2>Third-Party Services</h2>

<p>The app uses the following third-party services which may collect information:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Maps SDK for Android</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank">Firebase (Authentication, Firestore, Storage)</a></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Data Retention</h2>

<p>We keep data (photos, reviews, coordinates) only for as long as necessary to provide and improve the app‚Äôs functionality.  
You may request deletion of your submissions by contacting us.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Security</h2>

<p>We value your trust in providing us your information, thus we strive to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it.  
However, no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Children‚Äôs Privacy</h2>

<p>This app is not intended for anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.
